```
An issue in a Git repository is a way to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, or discussions related to the project. It serves as a centralized place for team members to collaborate and communicate about specific topics.
```
- **What is a _pull request_?**
```
A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository hosted on a platform like GitHub. It allows contributors to notify others about the changes they've made, discuss potential modifications, and merge the changes into the main branch of the repository after review.
```
- **How do I open up a _pull request_?**
```
To open a pull request, navigate to the 'Pull Requests' tab of the repository on GitHub, then click on the 'New pull request' button. Select the branches you want to compare, review the changes, add a title and description, and click on the 'Create pull request' button.
```
- **Give me a step-by-step guide on how to add someone to your repository.**
```

e. **What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?**
```
Git is a distributed version control system that allows users to manage and track changes to their codebase locally on their computer. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, along with collaboration features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.
```
f. **What does `git diff` do?**
```
The `git diff` command shows the differences between changes in the working directory, the staging area (index), and the commit history. It compares the current state of files in the working directory with the staged changes or with a specific commit.
```
```
- git add README.md
- git commit -m "Answer Questions* - nestorojas"
- git push origin master
```
